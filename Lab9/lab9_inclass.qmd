```{r}

db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary_2.csv")
#To remove comma in the original dataset use global substitution (gsub)
modified_data <- gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)
#To change the value to numeric, use as.numeric()
numeric_data <- as.numeric(modified_data)
#you can also turn this into a function
make_sum_numeric <- function(x){
    sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "",x)))

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
total <-make_sum_numeric(db$Total)
X.Ray_sum <- make_sum_numeric(db$X.ray)
X.Ray_protion <- (X.Ray_sum)/total*100
X.Ray_protion <- round(X.Ray_protion,3)
EM_sum <- make_sum_numeric(db$EM)
EM_protion <- (EM_sum)/total
EM_protion <- round(EM_protion, 3)
```
`r X.Ray_protion` of structures are solved by X-Ray and `r EM_protion` of structures are solved by EM. 

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
head(db)
#how to access to the last column
column_number <- ncol(db)
db[1,column_number]
protein_structure <- make_sum_numeric(db[1,8])
protein_protion <- protein_structure/total
protein_protion <- round(protein_protion,2)
```
`r protein_protion` of structures are proteins

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Skipped

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen is the smallest atom. It is hard to be captured. Oxygen is much larger than hydrogen and can be visualized.

The structure is too low a resolution to see a H atom. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see the Hydrogen atom. 

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

HOH308

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

#Working with Structures in R
We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb 
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

H2O and MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

#A list object, combine vectors... all things together
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
#has one chain A

```
 
```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction,Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a structural bioinformatics method to predict protein flexibility and potential functional motions (a.k.a. conformational changes).

m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
#bottom graphs interested to explore, peaks are regions that are more likely to move, more flexible 

```
Write out a "movie" (a.k.a. trajectory) of the motion for viewing in MOLstar

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
